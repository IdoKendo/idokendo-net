#### Ownership Delegation
How often has it happened to you at work that you wrote some piece of code and now you're its forever 
maintainer? And the longer you work in a place, the more of these obscure methods, classes, and pieces 
of code that whenever someone has a bug or a question that relates to it, they come to you.

How many times, and be honest with yourself here, have you said something along the lines of, 
"Oh, this is David's code, you better ask them about it"? And eventually when David gets asked, they 
need to dive into the code just the same as you would have. Who remembers their code from 9 months ago?

Some people really love the concept of *Feature Owners*. You wrote some code, so now you are its owner, 
you know what you did, and why you did it. And everytime it will be fastest for you to maintain it. 
I, however, really dislike it.
