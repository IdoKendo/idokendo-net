title: "Focus points for success"

#### Prelude
Since I'll be starting a new position soon, and I am expected to form a new team, I've started 
thinking what are the main focus points that I would like to emphasize with my team members, 
upper management, and all other parties involved.

I've come up with a few points that I feel are the backbone for a successful team, and would like 
to lay them out here, I wonder if I'll read this post in a year and have any different thoughts.

#### Understanding Motivation
It feels a bit redundant to exapnd on this too much, but it's such a fundamental concept, that it 
will make this post lacking without it. Developers can spiral down into a routine of writing code, 
deploying features, and back again. Without understaing the **why** it can be both demoralizing, 
and also lower the effectiveness and relevance of those features. 

When a developer understands what is the impact their code is making, they both feel better about 
their daily routine, and also they might even think about better, more fitting, solutions to the 
problems they face.

I am going to make sure my team always understand the motivation behind any and all features and requests.

#### Test Driven Development (or: Tests as documentation)
Something I am only recently starting to really understand, is the importance of unit tests, as 
points of reference and documentation. If a function's entire behavior is tested (consistently, on 
every deployment, at minimum) then these tests represent the contract of this function. It completely 
describes what is expected of this function, and how it should behave. These tests are hunderdfolds 
better than any written document that might describe the function's behavior.

The second benefit of having your entire code tested, is that you can be fearless about changes. If 
anything you change breaks anything, you will find it immediately, simply by running a:
```py
pytest
```
I always was fearless about changes, maybe to my detriment. But I feel that, as a professional developer, 
you should not shy from optimizing the code. If your code is fully tested, then you will also not break production.

I am going to push hard for developing using TDD methodology.

#### Agile, for real though
Many developers dislike Agile, but I think that it's just because they encounter other methodologies that 
disguise themselves as Agile. Daily stand up meeting that take upwards of 30 minutes, constant need to 
estimate tasks using hours or days, sprints without end goal, and others are just some of the stuff I've 
encountered myself as my managers would tell me we are working in Agile, while I found myself confused if they 
mean something else, actually.

Sprints should have deliverable, end goals - otherwise, what is the motivation of the sprint?  
Task estimates should be noted by points in comparison to other tasks, not by time frames - development is not that kind of activity.
Meetings should not be a hassle, they should only exist to help further the development.

I am going to make sure that Agile is used for good, and not abused by upper management.

#### EVERYTHING as Code
The same way that tests are a documentation of the code's behavior - IaC is the documentation for the environment 
that the code is running on. In my career, I've always experienced environments that were created manually, and 
are essentially "snowflakes".

There are other topics that are kept on flaky platforms, email chains, and the likes. This is information that gets 
lost to the annals of time.

I am going to push for everything to be documented as code.
